# Product Management

We often talk about project managers, and refer to what we do as projects, but *what is a project?*

The [PMI](http://www.pmi.org/) defines a project like this:
> A project can be defined as a **temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service.**

> Projects are different from other ongoing operations in an organization, because unlike operations, projects have a definite beginning and an end - they have a **limited duration**.

Others use projects to create the `v1.0` of a new product. We use [MVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

They use projects to plan and execute every new release. We use [continuous delivery](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html) to incrementally bring value to our customers.

In buildo, big projects don't exist. That's why we don't need a lot of traditional project management. The following sections outline our product management workflow, a continuous flow that starts with customer requests and ends with delivered business value.
