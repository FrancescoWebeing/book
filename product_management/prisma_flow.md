## PRISMA flow

1. Everything starts from a new **request** in Trello, typically added directly by the customer.
2. The requests is then refined, following our **requirements gathering guidelines**, and it becomes actionable by buildo.
3. The **actionable request** is then transformed into a GitHub issue, and tracked as a backlog card in Trello.
4. completion of the issue in GitHub triggers PRISMA to move the backlog card to "done"
5. in PRISMA a few more steps for approval and QA are set, depending on product needs

We call this the **PRISMA flow**. In this section we explain in detail this flow.

The PRISMA flow is a template on which to build your specific product development flow. Each product is different, and has a different implementation of the flow, but all flows..

- start from the PRISMA flow as a guideline
- are specified in written form
- are fully discussed and shared with the development team and the customer

This is the complete PRISMA flow:

It's divided into 4 sub workflows:

- customer requests workflow
- backlog grooming workflow
- dev workflow
- Q.A. workflow

The following 4 sections describe these workflows and their guidelines.
