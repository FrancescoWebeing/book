# Backlog grooming workflow
![](backlog_grooming.png)

This workflow starts from actionable requests, the output of requirements gathering, into a prioritized list of issues for developers, the **backlog**.

A backlog is well groomed if:
- issue requirements are of good quality and provide the necessary level of detail
- priorities are meaningful both for the customer and for buildo
- the backlog is long enough to keep developers busy on useful issues

## Converting actionable requests into issues

This is where we convert a Trello card to a GitHub issue. We are converting from customer language to developer language.

The exact conversion depends on the team. Typically, bigger teams will need more detailed reqs on issues, and the translated issue will be very different.

At the opposite side, for "teams" with a single person doing PM and dev this step is very light.

### Requirements and Specs
