# Code of Conduct

We have a very succinct code of conduct.

For the curious, here's the original document we used to discuss it: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/code-of-conduct-VnfduvHgNmOY0v3xqfnNC

As you can see, there were many points discussed, but we picked the top 5 so that we can really commit to them. This is exactly in the spirit of the second point of the CoC itself.

Recursion is a bitch.

Like everything in buildo, nothing is set in stone. CoC reflects  values we believe in. If we change our minds as a team, we'll change this.

Everyone is more than welcome to propose changes to the CoC.

In the next sessions we'll give suggestions on how to follow the CoC with the help of tools.

## Be on time at meetings

The definition of "on time" can be subjective. Take it as "exactly on time", and not "5 minutes late is OK", and you'll make everyone happy.

Meetings live in Google Calendar. If you want someone to join a meeting, remember to invite them and check they accepted your invite. Conversely, watch out for invites and RSVP in a timely manner (typically within a few hours is OK).

For bigger meetings in particular, prefer "loft 2" as the meeting area. There, you are free to talk aloud and discuss using whiteboards. If you specify the meeting area, people will more likely be there on time.

To remind yourself of a meeting, you can use Google Calendar on your phone, or enable the Slack integration [here](https://buildo.slack.com/services/gcalendar).
