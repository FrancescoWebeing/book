# Code of Conduct

We have a very succinct code of conduct.

For the curious, here's the original document we used to discuss it: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/code-of-conduct-VnfduvHgNmOY0v3xqfnNC

As you can see, there were many points discussed, but we picked the top 5 so that we can really commit to them. This is exactly in the spirit of the second point of the CoC itself.

Recursion is a bitch.

Like everything in buildo, nothing is set in stone. CoC reflects  values we believe in. If we change our minds as a team, we'll change this.

Everyone is more than welcome to propose changes to the CoC.

In the next sessions we'll give suggestions on how to follow the CoC with the help of tools.

## Be on time at meetings

The definition of "on time" can be subjective. Take it as "exactly on time", and not "5 minutes late is OK", and you'll make everyone happy.

Meetings live in Google Calendar. If you want someone to join a meeting, remember to invite them and check they accepted your invite. Conversely, watch out for invites and RSVP in a timely manner (typically within a few hours is OK).

For bigger meetings in particular, prefer "loft 2" as the meeting area. There, you are free to talk aloud and discuss using whiteboards. If you specify the meeting area, people will more likely be there on time.

To remind yourself of a meeting, you can use Google Calendar on your phone, or enable the Slack integration [here](https://buildo.slack.com/services/gcalendar).

## Commit only to what you are going to do

A commitment is created when two people, the performer and the requester, agree that one will do something for the other within a certain time.

A commitment should always be clearly put, and these attributes should be clear:

- Requester: the person who requested the task, and who accepts it when completed.
- Performer: the person who's responsible for the execution of the task, and who notifies the requester when done.
- Task: a clear specification of all that should be done.
- Due date: a date by which the task will be completed.

Consider this a negotiation, not an order. Both performer and requester must agree on the commitment.

Remember to notify the other if things change. In particular if something happens and the commitment cannot be hold.

To keep track of commitments, we don't yet have a standard way. Suggested tools are:

- Slack reminders (which you can set on others, too)
- Emails (you can use RightInbox to set reminders, or Google Tasks to convert emails into tasks with due dates)
- Trello boards (remember to have a due date on the card)

All such tools are good, as long as the commitment is written down and visible to both requester and performer.
