# Code of Conduct

We have a very succinct code of conduct.

For the curious, here's the original document we used to discuss them.

As you can see, there were many points discussed, but we picked the top 4 so that we can really commit on them. This is exactly in the spirit of the second point of the CoC itself.

Recursion is a bitch.

Like everything in buildo, nothing is set in stone. CoC reflects  values we believe in. If we change our minds as a team, we'll change this.

Everyone is more than welcome to propose changes to the CoC.
