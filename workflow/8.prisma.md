# prisma

[prisma](https://github.com/buildo/prisma) is a tool for gluing together Trello and GitHub

Its main goal is improving communication and transparency between buildo and our customers.

## prisma for developers

Due to its very nature, prisma is a double-faced tool. For developers working on GitHub it has a very direct consequence you should be aware of: issues with the label `customers` are visible to the customer.

The gist is: if you see the label `customers`, please refrain from posting insults in the issue description :-)

## prisma for PMs
prisma's bread and butter is project management.

We'll discuss about this topic extensively in the next chapters.
