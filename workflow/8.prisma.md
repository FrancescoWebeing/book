# PRISMA

[PRISMA](https://github.com/buildo/prisma) is a tool for gluing together Trello and GitHub.

Its main goal is improving communication and transparency between developers, product managers and customers.

To learn more about how PRISMA can help product managers and customer, refer to the "Product Management" chapter of this book.

If you're just interested in how PRISMA affects your life as a developer, you're in the right place!

## PRISMA for developers

Due to its very nature, PRISMA is a double-faced tool. For developers working on GitHub it has a very direct consequence you should be aware of: issues with the label `customers` are visible to the customer.

The gist is: if you see the label `customers`, please refrain from posting insults in the issue description :-)

### backlog and priority

As a developer, you are only concerned with the **backlog** column in PRISMA. For each card in the backlog, there is a corresponding issue in GitHub with the label `customers`.

The backlog gives you the issue priority: cards at the top come first. To make it easier, the issues for top 5 cards are marked with special labels in GitHub:

- 1 - highest priority
- 2 - high priority
- 3 - medium priority
- 4 - low priority
- 5 - lowest priority

Do not add these labels manually, they are kept in sync by PRISMA.

### give me some context!

Of course, issues in GitHub are always perfectly specified and 100% clear, no need to know more, right?

However, if you need some context on why the issue is there, or how those requirements came to be, you can go to PRISMA and have a look a the history behind the scenes.

If you find inconsistencies, talk to your PM. It's their job is to make sure the client wish becomes an actionable issue in GitHub, but some help is very appreciated :)
