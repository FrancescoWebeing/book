# Issues
An issue is where the discussion about a certain feature happens.

It contains all the necessary information for understanding the work that has to be done.

Issues can be of different kinds (feature, defect, bug, etc.) and each kind will have specific sections.

We won't get into specific details about these sections here. Such sections are pre-populated for you when using [workflow-pal](6.workflow-pal.md) and they have placeholders to guide you through the process. More on templates and workflow pal in future chapters.

We work in a dynamic environement, and templates are subject to changes as they adapt to our workflow, so don't expect them to be written in stone.

This also means that any constructive feedback is encouraged and welcome.
