## GitHub Workflow
Our development efforts happen on GitHub.

It's then not surprising that we follow the GitHub workflow.

It's an extremely simple, yet effective, way of collaborating.

The simplest possible description is

<p align="center">
<h2>ISSUE &rarr; PR &rarr; MERGE</h2>
</p>

More in depth, its core steps are:

- we want to implement the feature A
- we open an **issue** about the feature A, that contains:
  -  the "business" requirements &rarr; **what** is the high level goal?
  -  the proposed technical specs &rarr; **how** are we going to achieve it?
  -  any other relevant resource or comment
- a developer picks ups the issue, creates a **branch** and works on it
- as soon as the developer wants some feedback, (s)he opens a **pull request**
- discussions about the code happens on the pull request
- when the developer deems its code ready for review, (s)he:
  - writes down a **test plan** (more on this later)
  - **assigns** the PR a reviewer of its choice
- the reviewer **checks** the code, reports any concerns, the developer fixes them and finally the reviewer **merges** the PR

For a nice visualization and explanation of this workflow, you can refer to the official GitHub article about it: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

While the core workflow is almost identical, we've added some more structure to it.

The next sections are about this structure.

As you may guess, we use tools to help us enforce the it.
