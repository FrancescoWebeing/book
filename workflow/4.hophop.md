# hophop

The GitHub web interface is quite pleasant to use, but as developers we often "live" in the terminal.

That's why we developed [**hophop**](https://github.com/buildo/hophop), a minimal tool to accelerate the GitHub workflow from the command line.

hophop allows you to follow our GitHub worlfow without ever leaving the terminal. Here's the commands you'll be using every day:

| hophop command | workflow step |
| -- | -- |
| `hophop gh feature` | start working on an issue |
| `hophop gh pr` | create a PR about the current issue |

Did we say it's minimal?

Here's an example of how you use `hophop gh feature` to start working on an issue:

## a word about Toggl
[Toggl](toggl.com) is a time-tracking service we use on some projects. The idea is simple: you start working on something, you start the timer. We will then bill the hours to the final client.

Since starting a timer is an habit hard to get used to, we integrated toggl right in hophop, and it worked great for us.

#### my project doesn't use toggl, can I turn it off?
We don't support hophop configuration on a project-base yet, but [we're getting there](https://github.com/buildo/hophop/issues/40)!

Soon you'll be able to turn the toggl feature off where it doesn't make sense.
