# bitbar

[bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) is a lovely OSX utility that lets  you put the output from any script/program in the OS X menu bar.

At buildo we developed a few of bitbar scripts to help in keeping the status of your "GitHub backlog" always visibile.

We're going to discuss them briefly here. You can refer to their readmes for installation and other details.

## [pull requests](https://github.com/buildo/core/tree/master/scripts/github/pr-to-review)

We care a lot about code reviews, and it's important to perform them regularly in order not to block other teammates.

The first script is targeted at this: it displays the number of pull requests assigned to you, so that you don't forget about them.

## [issues](https://github.com/buildo/core/tree/master/scripts/github/assigned-issues)

In observance of our code of conduct, it's important to commit only to what you're going to do. For this reason, an assigned issue should be something you're currently working on, or that you plan to tackle soon.
