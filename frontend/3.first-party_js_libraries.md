# First-party js libraries

This is simply a list of "notable" buildo open source efforts in the JS/react ecosystem.

We tend to use the libraries listed here across all projects (with a few exceptions). Head to [webseed](https://github.com/buildo/webseed) for a comprehensive example touching many of these.

### metarpheus[-tcomb]
We use [metarpheus](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus) and [metarpheus-tcomb](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus-tcomb) to generate API domain models starting from a Scala/spray backend.

[metarpheus](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus) spits out a intermediate representation including API domain models and API routes for a Spray backend.

[metarpheus-tcomb](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus-tcomb) picks it up and output a customizable "transliteration" into JS / tcomb terms.

Here's the gist: [Example](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus-tcomb/blob/master/README.md#example).

### react-components

[react-components](https://github.com/buildo/react-components): A collection of reusable React components used at buildo.

When components are grown enough, they deserve their own repo: [flexview](https://github.com/buildo/react-flexview), [datepicker](https://github.com/buildo/rc-datepicker), [cookie-banner](https://github.com/buildo/react-cookie-banner), [autosize-textarea](https://github.com/buildo/react-autosize-textarea).

### flexview

Someone calls it `View`, someone calls it `fiv` (`div`.. got it?), here it is:

[flexview](https://github.com/buildo/react-flexview), a React component to abstract over flexbox.

### skinnable, pure
Originally part of [revenge](https://github.com/buildo/revenge), these small helpers are now used in all our react apps.

[`@pure`](https://github.com/buildo/revenge#pure) is a decorator applying to a component a standard shallow-equal `shouldComponentUpdate` implementation.

[`@skinnable`](https://github.com/buildo/revenge#skinnable) gives a standard way to split logic & template parts of a component.

Combined with [contains()](https://github.com/buildo/revenge#skinnablecontainscomponent) and [good conventions](guidelines/2.components.md), it is even more powerful.
