# First-party js libraries

**TODO**: discuss our own efforts in reusable libraries, mainly in "js" (not sure about the title)

examples:
  - metarpheus / metarpheus-tcomb
  - b-r-c
  - flexview
  - avenger
  - state handling
  - various component helpers (decorators, formerly known as revenge)
  - polifemo (we might want to write a chapter about testing, but not enough meat for now I think)
