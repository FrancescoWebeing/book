# buildo-react-components

To share basic components across our projects we collected them in a separate repository: https://github.com/buildo/react-components

From now on will refer to `buildo-react-components` as `b-r-c`

## Showroom

b-r-c has a loot of components. To help people find the correct one, we created a shiny [showroom](http://react-components.buildo.io/). Here you can interact with live demos and read documentation for every b-r-c component.

## Import

To reduce bundle size, b-r-c component should be imported directly:

```js
// Good
import Panel from 'buildo-react-components/lib/Panel';

// Wrong!
import { Panel } from 'buildo-react-components';
```

## JS Customization

b-r-c components should never be used directly inside a project.

To improve maintainability, we prefer to wrap them with a new component (usually named the same way). This wrapper component allows we to customize the b-r-c component adapting it every project.

```js
import BRCPanel from 'buildo-react-components/lib/Panel';

export default class Panel extends React.component {
 
  defaultProps = {
    dark: true // override Panel's default behavior
  }
  
  render = () => <BRCPanel {...this.props} />
}

```

## Style customization
As described in the CSS chapter, a component is composed by a JS part and a Style one.

When we import a b-r-c component, we need to import its style too. This is done inside the wrapper: the style is always imported by the JS part of a component that.

OK, but how do we customize the style to adapt it to our project theme?

Every b-r-c component has a SASS API interface that allows we to customize most of its style without writing a single CSS class!

To see a simple example of this SASS API you can check Badge's style file [here](https://github.com/buildo/react-components/blob/master/src/badge/badge.scss).

Back to the style customization, this is how we do it:

First of all we create a `.scss` file in the same folder of our wrapper name as the wrapper itself but in camelCase.

```
|_ Badge
   |_ Badge.js
   |_ badge.scss
```

In `panal.scss` we import the default style from b-r-c, but first we modify its variables to customize it:

```scss
/* badge.scss */
@import '~theme/variables.scss'; // project's variables

// override Badge's variable
$background: blue;
$active-background: red;

@import '~buildo-react-components/src/badge/badge.scss'; // Badge's default style from b-r-c
```

If SASS API is not enough, we can still overwrite class properties directly with CSS as usual:

```scss
/* badge.scss */
@import '~theme/variables.scss'; // project's variables

// overwrite Badge's variable
$background: blue;
$active-background: red;

@import '~buildo-react-components/src/badge/badge.scss'; // Badge's default style from b-r-c

// CSS overwrites
.badge {
  min-width: 34px;
  height: 22px;
}
```

You can see a real example of style customization [here](https://github.omnilab.our.buildo.io/buildo/web-shared/blob/master/src/app/components/Basic/Badge/badge.scss)
