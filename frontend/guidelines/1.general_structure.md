# General structure

In the following we'll try to sketch out what a typical react app should look like in terms of directory layout.

This is not to be intended as a strict guideline, as different projects could vary slightly and that's OK.

## Source code

All app source code should stay in `<project root>/src`:
```
src
|_ app
|  |_ routes
|  |_ components
|  |_ domain
|     ...
|_ client
|  |_ index.js
|  |_ [index-B.js]
|     ...
|_ [server]
```


## webseed

As an example, refer to [buildo/webseed](https://github.com/buildo/webseed).

It contains a basic example app integrating many of the standard tools we use across projects.

It should serve as a documented reference of a good way of structuring apps. We'll do our best to keep it up to date.
