# tcomb

Here we list a few additional conventions we like to follow when using tcomb. If you don't know what tcomb is, [here's a proper introduction](../javascript/3.typing_js.md).

## Naming types

Always give a `name` to defined tcomb types: it makes debugging much easier. You'll realize yourself the first time you'll find yourself debugging something like

```js

```

## Strictness

By default, tcomb `struct`s are loose, meaning they will happily accept (and strip away at instantiation time) additional props/field.

```js
const S = t.struct({ foo: t.String }, 'S');
const s = S({ foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar' }) // everything OK    ):
```

Fortunately, the default behavior can be changed as follows:

```js
const S = t.struct({ foo: t.String }, { name: 'S', strict: true });
const s = S({ foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar' }) // Error('additional prop `bar`')   (:
```

Even better, the default "strictness" can be set globally for all declared `struct`s setting `t.struct.strict = true` before defining your types.

As a general guideline, always use strict structs.
