## ESWat?

## Linting and Code conventions

We try to standardize as much as possible the code we write with two main objectives in mind:
- Someone reading the code later on should be able to *easily* understand what a given piece of code does. That person could be you. Respect your future self
- Some common pitfalls/potential bugs can be avoided with a certain style of code. For instance, bugs derived from mutating local state can be partially removed from day 0 if we allow only `const` and no `let/var`

The first objective requires the developer to come up with code that is as explicit and clear as possible, and the reviewer of a PR to enforce it at review time. For both points though, we can delegate much of the grunt work to a linter. Put it more clearly:

There are some things an automated tool can't buy you. For everything else, there's [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

[buildo/eslint-config](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-config) is a meticulously hand-crafted ESLint configuration that we use on all our projects. Except a few exceptions (you can always turn on/off rules for specific projects), it should exactly allow what we want and prevent much of the unwanted.

If you think the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is too nazi, think again. Come back after having tried [our own](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-config).
