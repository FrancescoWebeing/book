# JavaScript at buildo

This section should be an overview of how we use (or limit/tame/`<put your preferred against-js verb here>`) JavaScript per-se as a language at buildo.
Let's start by defining exactly which specification of the language are we talking about.

## ESWat?
 - babel & ESwhatever
   - pointers to guidelines/bundling for webpack

## Linting and Code conventions

We try to standardize as much as possible the code we write with two main objectives in mind:
- Someone reading the code later on should be able to *easily* understand what a given piece of code does. That person could be you. Respect your future self
- Some common pitfalls/potential bugs can be avoided with a certain style of code. For instance, bugs derived from mutating local state can be partially removed from day 0 if we allow only `const` and no `let/var`


### ESLint

The first objective requires the developer to come up with code that is as explicit and clear as possible, and the reviewer of a PR to enforce it at review time. For both points though, we can delegate much of the grunt work to a linter. Put it more clearly:

There are some things an automated tool can't buy you. For everything else, there's [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

[buildo/eslint-config](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-config) is a meticulously hand-crafted ESLint configuration that we use on all our projects. Except a few exceptions (you can always turn on/off rules for specific projects), it should exactly allow what we want and prevent much of the unwanted.

It contains rules for JavaScript, rules specific to react, and some additional rules provided by our own plugins like [no-loops](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-plugin-no-loops) and [no-copy-paste](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-plugin-no-copy-paste-default-export).

If you think the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is too nazi, think again. Come back after having tried [our own](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-config).

In addition, we also have a WIP [styleguide book](https://buildo.gitbooks.io/js-style-guide/content/guide/01.Types.html), in the same spirit of the `airbnb` one. This should serve as an explanation of the "whys" behind the rules in our eslint config, plus adding more shared code conventions in a descriptive form.

## Typing

As the informed reader might already know, JS doesn't offer us much in terms of types.

Taking for granted that the specification might never evolve to a better typed language (for backward compatibility and other valid reasons), the community is moving producing support and tooling for types in three main directions, which we'll explore briefly.
 
- **compile-to-js languages**: on the bright side, JS is an easy and profitable compilation target. There are many options around these days, basically every language on earth has some support for compilation to JS (examples are [Scala.js](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js), [purescript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript) and [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)). However, in terms of adoption of the JS community, we currently have a clear winner which is [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). The idea here is to have a superset of JS that stays very close to the original language, adding type annotations and a few keywords, but adds **static** type checking before the output of any valid JS code. In addition, the TypeScript compiler supports the latest ESWhatever features, and takes care of producing cross compatible bundles for you (so in a typical scenario you would also partially replace webpack/babel with TypeScript).
- **external *static* tools**: AKA [flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) (I'm not aware of any other comparable tool in this category). [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) runs alongside your dev/build pipeline, understands a superset of JS (various type annotations), adds type inference (so even for non-annotated sources), and does its magic (reports compile-time errors).
- **JS library**: As the even-more-informed reader might have guessed, in this world you loose the ability to do any static type checking, you're limited[^1] to the dynamic world.

[^1]: In terms of power and expressiveness this is not an actual limitation (the contrary is usually true). In terms of confidence though, it is sort of a bummer: you can't prove things without actually running the code. You are forced to explicitly stimulate any interesting `code-path X state`, which is basically impossible. The hard truth is that, in the real ("dynamic languages") world, this happens (more often than you might think) directly in production :(
