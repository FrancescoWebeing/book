# Front-end development

This chapter is about front-end **web** development at buildo.

We work on other kinds of front-end from time to time, but web (SPAs) constitutes the vast majority of our front-end work.

Guidelines provided here should be applicable to projects of various dimensions. When this doesn't hold true, we'll make sure to highlight it in a note. For instance, if your project doesn't need to interface with a remote API, you'll hardly want to integrate any of our tools&guidelines for data-fetching.

In the following we'll cover all of this (and maybe something more):
 - [JavaScript](./1.javascript_at_buildo.md)
 - [React and its ecosystem](./2.react.md)
 - [Our internal JS and react toolset](./3.first-party_js_libraries.md)
 - [Guidelines on how to structure a react application](./4.guidelines.md)
