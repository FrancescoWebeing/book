# Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a chat we use to discuss about anything.

You can join a conversation in a public channel or talk privately to a co-worker and it's a great way to keep the conversation while maintaining the office a quiet place.

Slack is a powerful tool and we've been using it for many years now. Here are some of the things we learned from experience.

## Private vs Public

If you're in a rush, here's the main gist: **always use public channels**, unless you have a very good reason.

If you want to know something more, read on.

### Public channels
Team awareness is extremely important, so - by default - prefer writing public channel to a private message.
Even if you are talking to a specific person, many times the information will be useful to other people, even when you don't realize it.

Remember that you can create new public channels easily, so if you are afraid to "spam" people you can create a new channel for the topic you want to discuss and move the conversation there.
Interested people can read the discussion in real-time or at a later time, and the information doesn't get lost in private conversations.

Also, if you think creating a new channel is "too much", you can start a thread from a specific message, so that you don't clog the main stream of the channel.

### Private direct messages
That being said, there are two main cases in which private direct messaging is appropriate:
- communications you explicitly want to keep private (e.g. discussing a personal topic with someone)
- extremely irrelevant information that you're sure won't be of interest to anyone: "Hey, can I talk to you in 5 mins?"

These cases (even though rarely) apply also to messaging more than one person: you can create a private conversation with multiple people, if you think it's appropriate (but think twice).

### Private channels
Private channels have a little use and should be generally avoided. They tend to persist once created and it's impossible to convert them to public channels, effectively locking everyone else out for no good reason.
Remember that you can create temporary private conversations with multiple people, without creating a channel.
If a private conversation has a reason to exist and a clear topic, then create a private channel, but again, think twice before doing so.
An example of a valid private conversation could be "person X surprise birthday party": it has a topic, it has a reason to be private and it is limited in time.

## Which channels should I join?
All channels have a description that helps you navigating around and see what you're interested in. 

Some channels are joined automatically when you signup to slack. These are long-lasting channels of general interest.

For all other channels, you can browse the list of available channels. You can click on a channel to preview it and decide whether to join.

## What's Slack (not) good for?
Discussions usually start on Slack, as it provides a frictionless way of communicating.

But pay attention: as soon as they evolve into something more structured, it's a good practice to move their output to some elsewhere, as Trello, GitHub, Paper, etc. 

Remember: Slack is a stream of messages, not knowledge base. As a rule of thumb, if you find yourself searching for something on Slack, you should probably take the opportunity move it somewhere more accessible.

Here's a few examples:

- we start throwing ideas about how to manage configurations on our webapps &rarr; we create a paper and update it with the result of the discussion
- we discuss about how to implement a feature &rarr; we update the specs of the relevant issue
- we decide what to talk about in a meeting &rarr; we update the meeting agenda
- we discuss on Slack about some outstanding GitHub PR/issue &rarr; we write a comment on GitHub with the outcome of the discussion, mentioning that we discussed it offline.

## The Team Directory
On Slack you can explore the profiles of other people using the Team Directory:

This serves a central point for retrieving all the basic info of your coworkers, including the cellphone numbers so that we can reach each other when internet is not an option. Everyone should add their phone number to the profile.

Finally, what kind of communication is if we can't see your face? Add a profile picture! ðŸ‘©ðŸ‘± 

## Tips and tricks

### Do not disturb mode
Slack's notifications can get in the way of your concentration. If you want some time off notifications, just use the DnD (to not disturb mode).

You can use the bell icon on the top left to start a DnD session or type `/dnd [duration]` in any chat (e.g. `/dnd 30m`).

You can also set a schedule for the DnD mode, so that it automatically starts and ends at a specific time (e.g. the working hours). By default, DnD is active from 10PM to 8AM, but you can change it in your preferences.

### Channels list
By default, the sidebar will show you all the channels you've joined. If you find this distracting, you can enable this setting:

Now the list on the left will be almost empty, with the exception of the channels with new updates and the starred ones.

### Jumping between channels
Probably the most-used shortcut in Slack: press `CMD` + `K` to quickly jump between channels. This gets even more useful if you've activated the setting above and you want to switch to a channel that has no new updates.

### Reminders
Slack has a fairly powerful reminder system. To set a reminder type anywhere `/remind [who] [what] [when]`. You can set reminders for youself, a coworker or a public channel. Examples:

- `/remind me to turn on the bat signal tonight at 11pm`
- `/remind @gabro in two hours to publish the buildo book chapter on reminders`
- `/remind #general to breath every day`

You can also view a list of the existing reminders, by typing `/remind list`.

Finally, you can set a reminder directly on a message.
