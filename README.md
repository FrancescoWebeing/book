# The buildo book


> You canâ€™t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families 
--  Jim McCarthy

Anyone with a laptop can write code. This is not what this book is about.

This book is about writing high-quality software. It's about doing so with people you trust and respect. And it's about doing all of the above in a smart and efficient way.

## Design for success
At buildo we believe in a simple concept: design for success.

And no, it's not a cheesy motivational motto.
Designing for success means trying to make the success case the easiest to achieve.

Suppose you'll face problems if a power plug is inserted in a wrong way.
How can you prevent the mistake to happen?

You have a number strategies available.

You could label the right side of the plug, so that it's easy for people to know how to insert it.

Or you can put a sign next to every power outlet.

Or you can define a process for plug insertion, hold a meeting, explain the process to everyone and inflict sanctions on those who fail at following it.

Or you can do this:

There's only one way of using it, and it's the right way. Anyone finds it natural and easy to use, and they don't even need to be aware the possibility of the mistake.

The UK power plug is designed for success.

While the parallelism with software development may seem far-fetched, this is what we do at buildo.

We want dangerous cases to be explicit, we want errors to be difficult to achieve and - ultimately - we want the success case to be the default one.
