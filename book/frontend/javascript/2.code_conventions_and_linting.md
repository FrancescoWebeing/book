# Code conventions and Linting

We try to standardize as much as possible the code we write with two main objectives in mind:
- Someone reading the code later on should be able to *easily* understand what a given piece of code does. That person could be you. Respect your future self
- Some common pitfalls/potential bugs can be avoided with a certain style of code. For instance, bugs derived from mutating local state can be partially removed from day 0 if we allow only `const` and no `let/var`


## ESLint

The first objective requires the developer to come up with code that is as explicit and clear as possible, and the reviewer of a PR to enforce it at review time. For both points though, we can delegate much of the grunt work to a linter. To put it more clearly:

There are some things an automated tool can't buy you. For everything else, there is [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint).

[buildo/eslint-config](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-config) is a meticulously hand-crafted ESLint configuration that we use on all our projects. Except a few exceptions (you can always turn on/off rules for specific projects), it should exactly allow what we want and prevent much of the unwanted.

It contains rules for JavaScript, rules specific to react, and some additional rules provided by our own plugins like [no-loops](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-plugin-no-loops) and [no-copy-paste](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-plugin-no-copy-paste-default-export). [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) allows us to apply it also to TypeScript code, but we don't have a well maintained shared configuration yet...stay tuned! ðŸ˜Ž

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) // our config makes eslint complain here!
```

If you think the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is too nazi, think again. Come back after having tried [our own](https://github.com/buildo/eslint-config).
