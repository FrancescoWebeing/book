# ESWat?
If you're new to the ES6 specification.. I'm sorry.
More seriously, this [introductory talk slides](https://speakerdeck.com/gabro/es2015-and-beyond) by @gabro should get you on track. For a more thorough review of new features and changes included in ES6, [ponyfoo.com](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6) is a good resource.

Now to a more practical point. We have a problem here:

And node is not much better. We are getting there, but we still need a transpilation step.

Fortunately, TypeScript compiles to clean JavaScript code which runs in any JavaScript engine that supports ES3 (or newer), while also offering support for the latest and evolving JavaScript features, including the ones from ES6 and future proposals[^1] like async functions and decorators.

What about plan JavaScript projects or pieces of code? In these cases, [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) comes to the rescue. Our typical JavaScript build/bundling setup includes a `babel` transpilation step through [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). We discuss the technicalities of this in other sections, but [here](https://github.com/buildo/scriptoni/tree/master/src/scripts/webpack) is an example configuration.

Given that this transpilation step is required, why limit to ES6?
`ESx` is a moving standard, especially these days: [ES2016](http://www.2ality.com/2016/01/ecmascript-2016.html), [ES2017](http://www.2ality.com/2016/02/ecmascript-2017.html).[^1]

Even before adopting TypeScript as our main language, we used some almost-standard features (e.g., [async-functions](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait)), and a few highly tentative ones (e.g., [object-rest-spread](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) and [decorators](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators/blob/master/README.md)), thanks to babel and various plugins supporting them.

Is this a good idea? Why not, as long as the following conditions are met:
- the feature improves our code. It makes it more readable, concise, or elegant.
- there's an easy escape procedure[^2]. If and when the proposal does not make it to a standard, and babel or other tools stop supporting it, it should be easy to "transpile back" (i.e., removing all usages in our codebase, possibly in an automated way. Hint: [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift))
- it is widely supported across different tools (mainly babel, eslint and editor highlighting), and the implementation is sufficiently stable (e.g., we won't start using a new fantasy-js feature implemented the night before by some drunk wannabe developer. Or, at least, we'll try not to).

[^1]: Here's the full list of currently active proposals: https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/blob/master/README.md
[^2]: For instance, we use `decorators` a lot. If we ever want to remove them, it should be a relatively easy static transformation on our codebase, given that they are not much more than a different syntax for 1-ary functions application.
