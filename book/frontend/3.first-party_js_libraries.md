# First-party libraries

This is simply a list of "notable" buildo open source efforts in the JS/react ecosystem.

We tend to use the libraries listed here across all projects (with a few exceptions). Head to [webseed](https://github.com/buildo/webseed) for a comprehensive example touching many of these.

### metarpheus[-tcomb]
We use [metarpheus](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus) and [metarpheus-tcomb](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus-tcomb) to generate API domain models starting from a Scala/spray backend.

[metarpheus](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus) spits out a intermediate representation including API domain models and API routes for a Spray backend.

[metarpheus-tcomb](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus-tcomb) picks it up and output a customizable "transliteration" into JS / tcomb terms.

Here's the gist: [Example](https://github.com/buildo/metarpheus-tcomb/blob/master/README.md#example).

### react-components

[react-components](https://github.com/buildo/react-components): A collection of general React components used at buildo.

Oh, and there's even a nice [showroom](http://react-components.buildo.io/)!

When components are grown enough, they deserve their own repo: [flexview](https://github.com/buildo/react-flexview), [datepicker](https://github.com/buildo/rc-datepicker), [cookie-banner](https://github.com/buildo/react-cookie-banner), [autosize-textarea](https://github.com/buildo/react-autosize-textarea), [react-placeholder](https://github.com/buildo/react-placeholder).

### flexview

Someone calls it `View`, someone calls it `fiv` (`div`.. got it?), here it is:

[flexview](https://github.com/buildo/react-flexview), a React component to abstract over flexbox.

Flexview it's so cool it has [its own book](http://buildo.github.io/react-flexview/) and a [live demo](http://react-components.buildo.io/#flexview) too!

### avenger

[avenger](https://github.com/buildo/avenger) `Promise` is to solve fetching, batching and caching problems for JS apps in a generic way.

`Promise` is obviously a joke. Everyone knows that `Observable` is a better model for a long-living client cache instance.

Take a look at the [readme](https://github.com/buildo/avenger).
