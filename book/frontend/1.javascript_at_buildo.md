# TypeScript and JavaScript at buildo

> *In August 2017 we adopted **[TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)** as our main front-end programming language. This section was first written to show how we used (or limited/tamed/`<put your preferred against-js verb here>`) JavaScript at buildo; however, most of the things we said are still valid now the we use TypeScript (e.g., code conventions). For this reason, you will see snippets written in JavaScript and notice that most of this section is still centered around it: it's fine, follow what it says anyway ;) You can also use it to understand why we decided to adopt TypeScript in the first place.*

This section should be an overview of how we use JavaScript and TypeScript per-se as programming languages at buildo.

- [ESWat](./javascript/1.eswat.md)
- [Code Conventions](./javascript/2.code_conventions_and_linting.md)
- [Typing JS](./javascript/3.typing_js.md)

Let's start by defining exactly which specification of the language we are talking about: [ESWat](./javascript/1.eswat.md).
