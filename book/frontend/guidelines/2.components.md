# Components

Components are the building blocks of any react UI. They are not all the same though...

> **NOTE** While the following doesn't apply to *all* our react projects as of now, we'll try to keep this always up to date with the latest.

## A Components Taxonomy

From a props/data perspective, there are three main kinds of components:

#### Containers

Containers are what we use to logically separate layout and data in our apps. They *contain* a plain component passing it the data that it needs and the callbacks that it should be able to trigger.

At the minimum, they can be defined by:
- the contained UI component
- the connected state (sync or async)
- a mapping function: `ContainerProps => ComponentProps`

To easily enforce this guideline (and to reduce boilerplate of course), we created this [`container` helper](https://github.com/buildo/react-container).

A typical `Container` component file could look like:
```ts
import container from 'container';
import { TransitionFunction } from 'state';
import MyPostComponent from 'MyPostComponent';

type MapProps = {
  postExpanded: boolean,
  transition: TransitionFunction
};
export default container(MyPostComponent, {
  connect: [ 'postExpanded' },
  queries: ['post'],
  mapProps: ({ postExpanded, transition }: MapProps) => ({
    expanded: postExpanded,
    onExpandToggle: () => {
      transition({ postExpanded: !postExpanded });
    }
  })
});
```

#### Plain Components

Typically always (except for very rare exceptions) pure (i.e., should be `React.PureComponent`s).

They should not be decorated with `connect`, `queries` or `commands`: delegate these jobs to a container.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

type Props = {
  expanded: boolean,
  onExpandToggle: () => void
};

export default class MyPostComponent extends React.PureComponent<Props> {
  render() {
    const { expanded, onExpandToggle } = this.props;
    const post = expanded ? 'Expanded' : 'Not expanded';

    return (
      <div className='post'>
        {post}
        <span onClick={onExpandToggle}>Click me!</span>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

## Directory layout

`Component`s should stay inside `src/app/components/..` and, if reused around the application, in `src/app/components/Basic/..`. The `Basic` subfolder should contain an `index.ts` to export all the basic components inside it.

A `Container` and the contained component should stay in the same folder, named as the `Component` itself,
and the folder should have an `index.ts` file exporting the `Container`:
```
Basic
|_ WorklistDropdown
  |_ index.ts
  |_ WorklistDropdown.tsx
  |_ WorklistDropdownContainer.ts
  |_ [worklistDropdown.scss]
```
Same story if the component doesn't have any container:
```
Basic
|_ Card
  |_ index.ts
  |_ Card.tsx
  |_ [card.scss]
```
In this way, we can always import from `Component` or `Basic`, whether it is a container or not.

## File Names
#### Component Directories

Should be named in *ComponentCase*, like `MyComponentsFolder`.

Applies mainly to `src/app/components` and `test/tests/components`, and to any other directory containing react components or component tests.

#### Component Files

`ts`/`tsx` files: should be named in *ComponentCase*, like `MyComponent.tsx` (except for `index` files).

`style` files: should be named exactly like relative component `tsx` file but in *camelCase*, like `myComponent.scss`.
