# Configuration 

We use [Scriptoni](https://github.com/buildo/scriptoni) to centralize and standardize the scripts used in our front-end projects, including `webpack`, `eslint` and some other stuff that we need to use everywhere and that we don't want to set-up and configure every time.

For more information refer to the project [README](https://github.com/buildo/scriptoni/blob/master/README.md).
