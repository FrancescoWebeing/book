# Tutorial
This tutorial is a [fork](https://github.com/buildo/webseed/tree/tutorial) of [webseed](https://github.com/buildo/webseed) and it will guide you through the creation of your first buildo front-end app.

The tutorial doesn't cover all our libraries, patterns and best practices, but it should be a good exercise to start with. We'll do our best to keep it up-to-date whenever something changes in our guidelines.
