# hophop

The GitHub web interface is quite pleasant to use, but, as developers, we often "live" in the terminal.

That's why we developed [**hophop**](https://github.com/buildo/hophop), a minimal tool built to accelerate the GitHub workflow from the command line. Here are the commands you'll be using every day:

| hophop command | workflow step |
| -- | -- |
| `hophop gh feature` | start working on an issue |
| `hophop gh pr` | create a PR about the current issue |

Did we say it's minimal? 

Here's an example of how you use `hophop gh feature` to start working on an issue:

## A word about Toggl
[Toggl](https://toggl.com/) is a time-tracking service we use on some projects. The idea is simple: you start working on something, you start the timer. We will then bill the hours to the customer.

Since starting a timer is a habit hard to get used to, we integrated toggl right in hophop, and it worked great for us.

#### My project doesn't use Toggl, can I turn it off?
Yes. Add a `.hophoprc` file to your repo and specify `toggl: no`. See https://github.com/buildo/hophop#hophoprc for more details.
