# workflow-pal

[`github-workflow-pal`](https://github.com/buildo/github-workflow-pal) is possibily the worst name for a project. Ever.

Despite that, it is a very useful piece of software which interacts perfectly with `nemobot` to provide buildoers an enhanced GitHub experience.

`github-workflow-pal` is a Chrome extension, that tweaks the GitHub interface to add a few useful features that we use in our daily workflow.

As we mentioned in the previous chapter, all the data it needs are retrieved from nemobot (e.g., the custom issue templates)

Here are some of its main features:

- custom issue types
