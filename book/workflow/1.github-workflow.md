# GitHub Workflow
Our development efforts happen on [GitHub](https://github.com/buildo) and on our private [GitHub Enterprise](https://github.omnilab.our.buildo.io/buildo).

It's then not surprising that we follow the GitHub workflow, an extremely simple, yet effective, way of collaborating.

The simplest possible description of it is

<p align="center">
<h2>ISSUE &rarr; PR &rarr; MERGE</h2>
</p>

More in depth, when we want to implement a new **feature** or fix a **bug**:

1. we open an **issue** about it
2. a developer picks ups the issue, creates a **branch** and works on it
3. as soon as the developer wants some feedback, (s)he opens a **pull request** from the created branch
4. discussions and peer **review** of the code happen on the pull request
5. the PR is **merged**

For a nice visualization and explanation of this workflow, you can refer to the official GitHub article about it: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

## GitHub workflow, buildo edition

This workflow is very simple, but it leaves some doubts. Let's enumerate a few:

- what does an issue look like?
- how should issues be grouped together?
- how does the review process work?

These are hard questions, and we tried to answer them. We've added some extra structure to the original GitHub workflow, to help us work better and faster as a team.

The next sections are about this structure.

As you may guess, we use tools to help us enforce it.
