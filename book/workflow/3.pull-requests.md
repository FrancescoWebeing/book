# Pull Requests

Pull requests are the bread and butter of developers.

Since high-quality code is a big priority for us, they are a crucial point in our workflow, because it's when code gets discussed and reviewed.

High-quality code requires high-quality reviews.

High-quality reviews require a high-quality PR.

So, what makes a PR high-quality? Read on!

## Test Plan
Whenever you submit a PR, you're responsible for at least two things:
- testing that your code works
- informing others about how you tested it

A test plan is an informal description of what you've done to make sure that your code works as expected.

Writing a test plan has two great benefits:
- other people see what you tested (and may spot something that you haven't)
- you are forced to think about possible test cases you missed


Just to be clear, we're not nazis about automatic testing: a test plan can be anything that gives a reasonable confidence in a working implementation.

Examples of valid test plans are:
- [reference to unit tests](https://github.omnilab.our.buildo.io/buildo/aliniq/pull/2572)
- [manual testing](https://github.omnilab.our.buildo.io/buildo/aliniq/pull/2548)
- [screenshots](https://github.omnilab.our.buildo.io/buildo/aliniq/pull/2541)

## Reviewability
PRs must be reviewable. This is a rather vague concept, but a few rules of thumb apply:

- don't make them too big

  <img width="33%" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4029499/23217749/99e357d4-f91a-11e6-8d84-7a29a6ec7479.png" />

  Nobody likes to review 2000 lines of code at once, so please don't make your PR humongous. There are exceptions to this (e.g. a project bootstrap), but, in general, prefer breaking your work into multiple PRs when the diff gets too long.

-  use commits wisely

  Break PRs into multiple commits, with a meaningful commit message. A review is much easier if each commit is reviewable independently.

- add a comprehensive test plan

  we mentioned this already, right? ;-)

## The PR Workflow
GitHub comes with [its own tools](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) for making code reviews.

They work fine for us, so we decided to define buildo's review process around them. The only addition we did is to consider the `assignee` of a PR as the person in charge of merging it.
The `assignee` is not required: if it's missing the author of the PR will be in charge of merging it.

This is how our code review process looks like:

*Note*: each step is associated with a precise label. This is done automatically by `@nemobot`!

### Work and PR Creation ("WIP")
- `John` works on a feature/fix branch

- `John` pushes a **decently structured** set of commits and opens a PR

- `John` tests his code and writes a nice **test plan** in the PR's body

- `John` is happy with his PR so he **requests a review** from `Sarah`, another developer who he thinks is the best reviewer for his code

### Code Review ("In review")
- Iteration between `John` and `Sarah`
  - **NO REBASES** are allowed until **every** reviewer has approved the PR
  - if `Sarah` makes a negative review, the PR goes back to the "WIP" state
    - Every fix/edit should be done through **new commits** to make their review easier

- `Sarah` is happy with the test plan and the code implementation so she approves the PR

### Merge ("Waiting for merge")
- The PR is ready to be merged on `master`, but `John` is not sure if it's the right moment to do it, so he **assigns the PR** to `Michael`, the lead developer of the project

- `Michael`, seeing that `Sarah` already approved the PR, finally merges the PR on `master`
